<h1>History of the International L and R series</h1>

<h2>Prior to 1950</h2>
	<p>Introduced in 1947 was the KB, the predecessor to the L series. The KB trucks had bulky shapes, only seated two, and were harder to see out of, due to the thick A-pillars and a two piece windsheild. The hood was a two piece bi-fold style, and the fenders were more rounded. The trucks had more chrome on the grill, and had a more pointed front end. This design was around from 1946/1947-1949.</p>
	
<h2>The L series is born in 1950 - First version</h2>
	<p>Introduced in 1950 was the L series, and the L series was a first of its kind for International. The truck had been completly redesigned, and featured:
	<ul>
		<li>A new cab design</li>
		<li>A new box design</li>
		<li>A new engine model</li>
		<li>The fancy new "syncromesh" transmissions</li>
		<li>And finally, a new hood and front grill design.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>1. The new cab design was dubbed the "Comfo-cab", due to its new 3 passenger seating capacity, the new larger one piece windshield, the smaller A-pillars, and the larger cab space. It also featured International's new door design, and the new "hidden hinges," hinges that were on inside the door. Unfortunately, this design had many problems, and was later removed.</p>
	<p>2. The new box design was slightly bigger than the previous years' design, and featured an all new tailgate, and newly designed fenders.</p>
	<p>3. The new OHV(Overhead valve) Silver Diamond were available in two sizes, the 220cid, and the 240cid. The 220cid was more common among the lighter duty L's, such as the L-110's (1/2 ton) and the L-120's (3/4 ton). The L-130's (1 ton) recived the 240cid engines.</p>
	<p>4. The new "syncromesh" transmission was International's 3, 4, or 5 speed transmissions, and alllowed the driver to shift from first to second, then second to thrid, and then downshift to second again. Some trucks were available with non-syncromesh transmissions, and those ranged from four speed to five speed only. Three speed transmissions had the shifter mounted on the steering collumn, and was called "three on the tree." Four speed transmissions had the shifter mounted on the floor, in the middle of the cab., and that was called "four on the floor."</p>
	<p>5. The new grill and fenders were more flat, and had less chrome, and were more simple. </p>

<h2>The L series is revised in 1951 - Second version</h2>
	<p>In 1951, International redesigned the door hinge system, and moved the hinges outside of the door. This allowed mirrors to be mounted on the hinge now.</p>
	<p>Fun fact, International trucks only had one mirror, one taillight, and one sunvisor, all on the drivers side. Owners were able to purchase spare mirrors, taillight housings, and sunvisors for the passenger side, depending on if the driver wanted to go to the extra effort to mount them.</p>

<h2>The R series is born in 1952</h2>
	<p>In 1952, the L series finished production, and International rolls out the R series. The R series was a minor remodel of the L series, and featured the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A new grill design</li>
		<li>A hood remodel</li>
		<li>A new IH logo</li>
	</ul>
	<p>1. The new grill featured no chrome, and was more rounded. This was the biggest design change on the R's</p>
	<p>2. The hood now featured a small vent at the top of the grill, but was similar to the L's in shape.</p>
	<p>3. The new logo changed from the Triple Diamond style to the simple IH style.</p>
	<p>Fun fact: The R-110 cost only $1,384 when brand new!</p>
	
<h2>The S series is born in 1955</h2>
	<p>In 1955, the R series finsished production, and the S series was rolled out. The S series featured the most design changes to the body since 1950, and featured the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A new grill design</li>
			<li>A hood remodel</li>
			<li>New fender designs</li>
		</ul>
	<p>1. The new grill design featured headlight buckets that were located farther out than in previous years, and fetaured park lamps in the middle of the two slats on the grill, at opposite ends.</p>
	<p>2. The hood remodel featured new locks at the end of the hood.</p>
	<p>3. New fenders were designed to accomodate the new healight location, which was at the top of the fender facing out. The fenders also had a bit of a curve behind the healdight, just make it more streamlined.</p>
	<p>Fun fact: The S series was re-introduced in 1977! International rolled out a new line of heavy duty dump trucks, named the S series! Although, they looked nothing like the pervious S series!</p>
	
<h2>The sucessor to the S is born in 1957... the A and B series.</h2>
	<p>Well, like all good things, they must come to an end. In 1957, International introduced the A series, which had a similar cab shape to the S, but was different. Heres what they changed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A new grill design</li>
		<li>A new hood</li>
		<li>New fender designs</li>
		<li>No more running boards</li>
		<li>New headlight designs</li>
	</ul>
	<p>1. The new grill design</p>
	<p>2. The new hood now hinged at the rear, and now looked more like modern trucks.</p>
	<p>3. The new fender design was</p>
	<p>4. The A series featured deleted running boards, as the cab was now lower to the ground.</p>
	<p>5. New headlights and signal lights were designed for the A and B series, and had a chrome plate that went around them.</p>
	<p>Fun fact: Because this was intoduced for International's 50th year of production, there was a gold and white two-tone Golden Jubilee Custom Pickup package available, featuring some special equipment.</p>
