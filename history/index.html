<h1>History of the International L and R series</h1>

<h2>Prior to 1950</h2>
	<p>Introduced in 1947 was the KB, the predecessor to the L series. The KB trucks had bulky shapes, only seated two, and were harder to see out of, due to the thick A-pillars and a two piece windsheild.</p>
	
<h2>The L series is born in 1950 - First version</h2>

<h2>The L series is revised in 1951 - Second version</h2>

<h2>The R series is born in 1952</h2>

<h2>The S series is born in 1955</h2>

<h2>The sucessor to the S is born in 1957... the A and B series.</h2>
